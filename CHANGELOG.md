# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow semantic-ish versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`),
where a new `MINOR` marks a playable milestone reaching `main`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Headless swing smoke test (`tests/SwingSmokeTest.tscn`), wired into CI, asserting
  the core loop: knockback, stamina cost, and the `hit_landed` signal.
- Live **web demo** on GitHub Pages, auto-deployed from `main` via
  `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (single-threaded HTML5 export so it runs on Pages
  without cross-origin-isolation headers): <https://dd-ching.github.io/arthur-stone-weapon-system/>
- `export_presets.cfg` with a Web preset.

### Planned
- Phase 2 (Game Feel): hit-stop, impact particles, audio hooks, camera-shake shaping.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-20

The first playable prototype: **2D Heavy Weapon Prototype**. Proves the core
mechanic — Arthur is powerful because he lifted the whole stone, but the stone
makes him slow, vulnerable, and hard to control.

### Added
- Godot 4 project structure, input map, and a runnable main scene (`Arena.tscn`).
- `Arthur` character with momentum-based movement (low acceleration, sliding stop).
- `StoneWeapon` heavy swing with a four-state machine: ready → wind-up → active → recovery.
- Hold-to-charge swing: tap for a quick heavy hit, hold to wind up a bigger one.
- Stamina system: spend-on-swing, post-swing regen delay, and an exhaustion fizzle
  that drops you straight into recovery.
- Knockback applied to target dummies, with wall rebound and a per-dummy hit counter.
- Four target dummies and a walled test arena with a faint reference grid.
- A follow `Camera2D` with impact-scaled screen shake.
- Minimal HUD: stamina bar, live weapon-state read-out, and on-screen control hints.
- `R` to reset the arena.
- Project docs: README, ROADMAP, concept, controls, design goals, architecture, build notes.
- First devlog entry.

### Notes
- All visuals are placeholder shapes drawn in code — game feel over polish, by design.
- No audio, no enemy AI, no win condition yet. See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).
